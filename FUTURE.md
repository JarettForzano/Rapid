# Future plans for the project
- AWS cloud to host the SQL database for easier and better handing (since local was just the exmaple)
- Updating make file to allow for all different systems to use my software
- Creating a docker container with the project on it
- Getting all of the information inside a config folder for Rapid which holds the megacmd config and rapid config
- Better error handling and more case uses
- probably more once i think of it
